   GitHub stars are the metric by which the success of frameworks gets measured. We need 1,200 GitHub stars to make Trongate a top ten PHP framework. If Trongate becomes a top ten PHP framework, it will be one of the most electrifying events in the history of PHP!

## :star2: About the Project

<div align="left"> 
  <p>The Trongate Desktop App is an Electron-based application designed to streamline development with the Trongate PHP framework. It offers a range of features to enhance productivity and simplify the development process.</p>
  <p>The Trongate framework was built with a love of pure PHP and a belief that PHP is best when it's easy, stable, and fast. It actively rejects PSR-4 auto-loading, Composer, Packagist, rewrite culture, certification, and all forms of bureaucracy.</p>
  <p>The Trongate framework is free, as is the desktop app, and they always will be. That's a promise!</p>
</div>

<!-- Getting Started -->

## :toolbox: Getting Started

<h3>Create Trongate apps</h3>

- The Trongate Desktop App can be downloaded for Mac, Windows, and Linux
  - [from the Trongate website](https://trongate.io/download)

<p>Have MariaDB or MySQL installed and running, either with Xampp or similar <i>(note some people have had connection issues with MySQL on a Mac - usually solved with permission fixes)</i></p>

<h3>Develop and/ or build the Desktop App</h3>
<p>Ensure Nodejs is installed, clone this repo.  Change directory into it and run this command to install the 'Node Modules' needed</p>

- Node.js v18.17.1 and npm 9.6.7 installed
  - Electron v27.3.5 (auto installed as dev dependancy)
  - Electron Builder v24.13.3 (auto installed as dev dependancy)

<p><i>Note: the versions above were bumped up to the latest stable versions, which are close to what DC used at the time of creating the Desktop App - You can use later versions but please alway match the Electron version with the correct Node version - https://releases.electronjs.org/ use the Node Version manager to swap Node versions</i></p>

`npm install`

<p>To run the Desktop app from the downloaded repository</p>

`npm run start` or `npx electron .`

<p>or install Electron globally</p>

`npm install electron@26.2.1 -g`

<p>and run it like this</p>

`electron .`

<p>Create a .gitignore file if you intend to post pull requests</p>

```
# DC stuff
_junk/

# Node artifact files
dist/
node_modules/
package-lock.json

# Git files
.gitignore
```

## Compile the Desktop App

### Windows

`npx electron-builder -w` or `npm run electron:win`

Edit 'package.json' "win": {"target": "zip"}

- change output to a zip file > set 'target' to 'zip'
- change output as a self installer - note: both will install to %localAppData%\Programs\Trongate\
  - (exe) > set 'target' to 'nsis'
  - (msi) > set 'target' to 'msi'

### Mac

`npx electron-builder -m` or `npm run electron:mac`

### Linux

`npx electron-builder -l` or `npm run electron:linux`
